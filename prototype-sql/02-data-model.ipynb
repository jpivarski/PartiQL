    "Compared to what is provided in most general-purpose programming languages, only a small set of abstract data types are needed for analysis (or high-level programming in general). Numbers, booleans, and fixed-size (rectangular) arrays of numbers and booleans are sufficient for data analysis in most fields of study. Particle physicists demonstrably need variable-length lists of numbers and booleans as well: interest in awkward-array has overwhelmingly focused on the `JaggedArray` class, which only provides this capability. For the intuitive notion of a \"particle object,\" some sort of record type is needed as well. To manipulate sets without restriction, we also need heterogeneity, which can be expressed by a union type."

Unions and records are the sum types and product types of [algebraic type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), respectively.

Awkward-array is PLURP with extra features beyond just representing types.\n",

For instance, an open file object is an integer that makes system calls, a linked list is a tree of records, and a hash-table is a list with hash-collision handling. PLURP provides a layer of abstraction between raw, serialized memory (e.g. the arrays and structs of the C programming language) and rarified types of a high-level language (e.g. classes with hidden implementations)."

Natural keys are meaningful for time measurements in time series or latitude/longitude coordinates in geographical data, but no values in a particle physics dataset would make sense as a natural key.

    "Many mathematical operations apply to scalars, such as addition, square root, exponentiation, etc. In array programming, they can be applied to all members of two or more arrays if the arrays have the same length (or n-dimensional shape) by lining up the arrays and performing the operation on each scalar element. Awkward-array extends this to arrays of variable-length lists, as long as the lengths in each input are the same when aligned. The same can be applied to sets if they have the same index.\n",

    "What if a user tries to join `muons` and `jets` to add their `pt`? Such an operation should be illegal because we can never guarantee that there's the same number of `muons` and `jets` in each event and there is no natural mapping from one set to the other set. Awkward-array *usually* forbids such an operation because there is *usually* at least one event in a large dataset with a different number of `muons` than `jets`. With indexes, we can *always* forbid such an operation because they have non-overlapping indexes (no keys in common).\n",
    "\n",
    "What if a user tries to join `filteredMuons` or `muonsWithCorrections` to `muons`? Such an operation should be legal and it would often be useful. If there is a different number of `filteredMuons` or `muonsWithCorrections` than `muons`, even in one event, awkward-array cannot combine them. With indexes, we can *always* perform such operations because the filtered or transformed muons carry over their indexes—their identities—through the filtering or transformation.\n",

    "To ensure that `B` and `C` are both transformed versions of the same particles, keys must be compared by reference, not by value. The second muon in the first event has row index `[0, 1]` and the second jet in the first event also has row index `[0, 1]`, but they are not the same key because they don't derive from the same index. We can't disambiguate them on their column indexes, `[\"muons\", \"pt\"]` and `[\"jets\", \"pt\"]`, because we should be able to join different columns, such as `[\"muons\", \"pt\"]` and `[\"muons\", \"iso\"]`. When indexes are created, each index should have a globally unique identifier that gets passed through operations so that we can distinguish, e.g. `#0[0, 1]` from `#1[0, 1]`."
