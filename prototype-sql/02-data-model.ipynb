    "Compared to what is provided in most general-purpose programming languages, only a small set of abstract data types are needed for analysis (or high-level programming in general). Numbers, booleans, and fixed-size (rectangular) arrays of numbers and booleans are sufficient for data analysis in most fields of study. Particle physicists demonstrably need variable-length lists of numbers and booleans as well: interest in awkward-array has overwhelmingly focused on the `JaggedArray` class, which only provides this capability. For the intuitive notion of a \"particle object,\" some sort of record type is needed as well. To manipulate sets without restriction, we also need heterogeneity, which can be expressed by a union type."

    "The following four type generators (\"PLUR\") provide a system of surprising generality:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **P**rimitive integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and any fixed byte-width value (e.g. UUIDs, IP addresses, ...),\n",
    "   * **L**ists of variable length but homogeneous type,\n",
    "   * **U**nions of heterogeneous types, such as \"electrons and muons\" (with different fields in each), and\n",
    "   * **R**ecords of named, typed fields (a.k.a. objects, structs, composites, classes...).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, JSON (with a schema) is a PLUR system, in which numbers, boolean, and `null` are the primitives, and strings are regarded as a special case of \"lists of 1-byte characters.\" Protobuf, Avro, Thrift, Parquet, and Arrow are statically typed PLUR systems. Unions and records are the sum types and product types of [algebraic type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), respectively. Only one thing from general-purpose programming might be missed by physicists:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **P**ointers between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can add this as a fifth type generator (\"PLURP\") by allowing cross-references and circular references. In a PLUR system, data structures are trees with a maximum depth, limited by the type schema, but in a PLURP system, data structures may be arbitrarily deep trees or even graphs. Awkward-array is PLURP with extra features beyond just representing types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types in a general-purpose programming language can be constructed from the above if interpreted through the appropriate interfaces. For instance, an open file object is an integer that makes system calls, a linked list is a tree of records, and a hash-table is a list with hash-collision handling. PLURP provides a layer of abstraction between raw, serialized memory (e.g. the arrays and structs of the C programming language) and rarified types of a high-level language (e.g. classes with hidden implementations)."

    "Awkward-array has been useful as a Numpy extension for particle physics, and I expect its role to increase. However, I don't think the array-programming paradigm is good for all problems. In fact, I'd like to provide three ways to perform computations on these same data structures:\n",

    "   * array programming, in which the columnar nature of the arrays is visible and there is no index,\n",

    "   * declarative programming, in which the columnar nature of the arrays is hidden and there is an index to define identity for set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is for the three paradigms to be usable on the same data structures without translation. For example, a physicist-user might apply a first transformation of their data as an array, then do something more complex in a Numba-compiled block, treating the records as Python objects (though Numba compiles their actions into array manipulations under the hood), then do something even more complex, relying on the identity of records in a way not possible in imperative programming, using a declarative language like PartiQL."
