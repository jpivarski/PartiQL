    "Compared to what is provided in most general-purpose programming languages, only a small set of abstract data types are needed for analysis (or high-level programming in general). Numbers, booleans, and fixed-size (rectangular) arrays of numbers and booleans are sufficient for data analysis in most fields of study. Particle physicists demonstrably need variable-length lists of numbers and booleans as well: interest in awkward-array has overwhelmingly focused on the `JaggedArray` class, which only provides this capability. For the intuitive notion of a \"particle object,\" some sort of record type is needed as well. To manipulate sets without restriction, we also need heterogeneity, which can be expressed by a union type."

Awkward-array is PLURP with extra features beyond just representing types.\n",

Natural keys are meaningful for time measurements in time series or latitude/longitude coordinates in geographical data, but no values in a particle physics dataset would make sense as a natural key.

Such an operation should be illegal because we can never guarantee that there's the same number of `muons` and `jets` in each event and there is no natural mapping from one set to the other set. Awkward-array *usually* forbids such an operation because there is *usually* at least one event in a large dataset with a different number of `muons` than `jets`. With indexes, we can *always* forbid such an operation because they have non-overlapping indexes (no keys in common).\n",

    "What if a user tries to join `filteredMuons` or `muonsWithCorrections` to `muons`? Such an operation should be legal and it would often be useful. If there is a different number of `filteredMuons` or `muonsWithCorrections` than `muons`, even in one event, awkward-array cannot combine them. With indexes, we can *always* perform such operations because the filtered or transformed muons carry over their indexes—their identities—through the filtering or transformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure that `B` and `C` are both transformed versions of the same particles, keys must be compared by reference, not by value. The second muon in the first event has row index `[0, 1]` and the second jet in the first event also has row index `[0, 1]`, but they are not the same key because they don't derive from the same index. We can't disambiguate them on their column indexes, `[\"muons\", \"pt\"]` and `[\"jets\", \"pt\"]`, because we should be able to join different columns, such as `[\"muons\", \"pt\"]` and `[\"muons\", \"iso\"]`. When indexes are created, each index should have a globally unique identifier that gets passed through operations so that we can distinguish, e.g. `#0[0, 1]` from `#1[0, 1]`."

Knowing now what is required for set operations—a `d×N` matrix of integers where `d` is the depth and `N` is the length of an internal array, with no need for a column index—awkward 1.0 can be written to accomodate for this data structure. In fact, if an index is present, it can be passed through the array programming interface, to ensure that array programming and declarative set operations can be interleaved."
