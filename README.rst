AwkwardQL - SQL-like language for awkward arrays
================================================

.. inclusion-marker-1-do-not-remove

A SQL-like language for doing set operations on data in Awkward Arrays.

.. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-remove

This is derived from and inspired by the `demo <https://github.com/jpivarski/PartiQL>`_ by Jim Pivarski (PartiQL) and targets awkward 1.0.

We will start out focusing on particle physics uses cases and see how far it goes from there. :-)

Installation
============

Install coffea like any other Python package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install awkwardql

or similar (use ``sudo``, ``--user``, ``virtualenv``, or pip-in-conda if you wish).

Strict dependencies
===================

- `Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`__ (3.6+)

The following are installed automatically when you install coffea with pip:

- `awkward1 <https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array>`__ to manipulate complex-structured columnar data, such as jagged arrays;
- `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`__ just-in-time compilation of python functions;
- `lark <https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ a modern and well featured parser/lexer/interpreter engine;
- `numpy <https://scipy.org/install.html>`__ for flat array manipulation;
- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ as a plotting backend;
