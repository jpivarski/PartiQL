AwkwardQL - SQL-like language for awkward arrays
================================================

.. inclusion-marker-1-do-not-remove

A SQL-like language for doing set operations on data in Awkward Arrays.

.. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-remove

This is derived from and inspired by the demo by Jim Pivarski (PartiQL) and targets awkward 1.0.

We will start out focusing on particle physics uses cases and see how far it goes from there. :-)

Installation
============

Install coffea like any other Python package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install awkwardql

or similar (use ``sudo``, ``--user``, ``virtualenv``, or pip-in-conda if you wish).

Strict dependencies
===================

- `Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`__ (3.6+)

The following are installed automatically when you install coffea with pip:

- `awkward1 <https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array>`__ to manipulate complex-structured columnar data, such as jagged arrays;
- `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`__ just-in-time compilation of python functions;
